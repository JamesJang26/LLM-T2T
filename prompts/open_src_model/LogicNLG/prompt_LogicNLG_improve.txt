Original claim: st kilda scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, 1941
Reasoning: footscray scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, not st kilda. So the claim has instrinsic error. My instruction is to replace st kilda with footscray.
New claim: footscray scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, 1941.

Original claim: geelong was the home team with the highest score
Reasoning: in the home team score column, home team geelong did have the highest score. So the claim has no error. My instruction is to do nothing.
New claim: geelong was the home team with the highest score.

Original claim: the crowd on 21 june 1941 was larger than the crowd on 2000
Reasoning: there is no information about crowd on 2000. So the claim has extrinsic error. My instruction is to rewrite the whole claim.
