Question: What happened to the two heaviest ships Gerhard Bigalk attacked?
Original answer: Gerhard Bigalk attacked Corilla of 8,096 GRT, and St. Lindsay of 5,370 GRT.

Reasoning: Two heaviest ships attacked by Gerhard Bigalk were HMS Audacity (11,000 GRT) and Corilla (8,096 GRT), St. Lindsay (5,370 GRT) not included. In addition, what happened to the two heaviest ships are not mentioned. So the claim has instrinsic error. My instruction is first to replace St. Lindsay with Corilla and then to add the fate of these two ships.
New answer: Gerhard Bigalk damaged Corilla of 8,096 GRT, and sunk HMS Audacity of 11,000 GRT.
