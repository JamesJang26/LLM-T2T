Your task is to provide feedback on claims derived from tables. Your feedback should consist of identifying errors, providing explanations for your reasoning, offering evidence for the presence or absence of errors and finally, presenting a new improved claim. There are two types of errors: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic errors refer to mistakes that arise from within the claim itself, while extrinsic errors are caused by factors external to the claim. To help you provide accurate feedback, we have provided instruction templates for your use. These templates include "remove," "add," "replace," "modify," "rewrite," and "do nothing". It is important to note that you should be capable of identifying logical operations when reviewing claims. Examples of such operations include superlatives, exclusives (such as "only"), temporal relationships (such as "before/after"), quantitative terms (such as "count" or "comparison"), inclusive/exclusive terms (such as "both/neither"), and arithmetic operations (such as "sum/difference" or "average").
To guide your responses, we have provided two example templates with three claims each. Use these templates to structure your answer, provide reasoning for your feedback, and suggest improved claims. We encourage you to think through each step of the process carefully.
Remember, your final output should always include a “New claim” no matter if there is error or not! It is the most important part of your response.


Example 1:
Title: 1941 vfl season
Table:
home team | home team score | away team | away team score | venue | crowd | date
richmond | 10.13 (73) | st kilda | 6.11 (47) | punt road oval | 6000 | 21 june 1941
hawthorn | 6.8 (44) | melbourne | 12.12 (84) | glenferrie oval | 2000 | 21 june 1941
collingwood | 8.12 (60) | essendon | 7.10 (52) | victoria park | 6000 | 21 june 1941
carlton | 10.17 (77) | fitzroy | 12.13 (85) | princes park | 4000 | 21 june 1941
south melbourne | 8.16 (64) | north melbourne | 6.6 (42) | lake oval | 5000 | 21 june 1941
geelong | 10.18 (78) | footscray | 13.15 (93) | kardinia park | 5000 | 21 june 1941

Original claim: st kilda scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, 1941
Reasoning: footscray scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, not st kilda. So the claim has instrinsic error. My instruction is to replace st kilda with footscray.
New claim: footscray scored the most point of any team that played on 21 june, 1941.

Original claim: geelong was the home team with the highest score
Reasoning: in the home team score column, home team geelong did have the highest score. So the claim has no error. My instruction is to do nothing.
New claim: geelong was the home team with the highest score.

Original claim: the crowd on 21 june 1941 was larger than the crowd on 2000
Reasoning: there is no information about crowd on 2000. So the claim has extrinsic error. My instruction is to rewrite the whole claim.
New claim: the crowd of richmond versus st kilda was larger than the crowd of hawthorn versus melbourne.


Example 2:
Title: 2008 universitario de deportes season
Table:
nat | name | moving to | type | transfer window
per | rivas | górnik zabrze | transfer | winter
per | v zapata | alianza atlético | transfer | winter
per | tragodara | atlético minero | loaned out | winter
per | correa | melgar | loaned out | winter
per | curiel | alianza atlético | transfer | winter

Original claim: all of the transfer window for the 2008 universitario de deportes season are winter
Reasoning: in 2008 universitario de deportes season, all of the transfer windows were winter. So the claim has no error. My instruction is to do nothing.
New claim: all of the transfer window for the 2008 universitario de deportes season are winter.

Original claim: v zapata and v zapata are the only transfer
Reasoning: v zapata is not the only transfer. So the claim has instrinsic error. My instruction is to remove the redundant v zapata and add rivas and curiel.
New claim: v zapata, rivas and curiel were transfer.

Original claim: v zapata and curiel were both moving to alianza atlético
Reasoning: v zapata and curiel were both moving to alianza atlético. So the claim has no error. My instruction is to do nothing.
New claim: v zapata and curiel were both moving to alianza atlético.


Now please give feedback to the claim of the new table and give the edited claim. Let's think step by step and follow templates of examples. But you cannot miss the new claim part.
