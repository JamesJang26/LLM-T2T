Your task is to provide 5 different consistent claims derived from a table. Consistent means that all information of your claims should be supported by the corresponding table. Provided 5 claims should be different from each other.
To guide your responses, we have provided one example table with five claims. Use the template to structure your answer, provide reasoning for your claims and suggest claims. We encourage you to think through each step of the process carefully.
