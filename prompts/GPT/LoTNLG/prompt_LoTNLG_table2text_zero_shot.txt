Your task is to provide 5 different consistent claims derived from a table according to the given corresponding logical labels. Consistent means that all information of your claims should be supported by the corresponding table. There are 9 kinds of logical labels in total, which are "aggregation", "negation", "superlative", "count", "comparative", "ordinal", "unique" , "all" and "none". The detailed explanation of these logical type labels are shown as follows. Provided 5 claims should be different from each other.

1. aggregation: the aggregation operation refers to sentences like "the averaged age of all ....", "the total amount of scores obtained in ...", etc.
2. negation: the negation operation refers to sentences like "xxx did not get the best score", "xxx has never obtained a score higher than 5".
3. superlative: the superlative operation refers to sentences like "xxx achieves the highest score in", "xxx is the lowest player in the team".
