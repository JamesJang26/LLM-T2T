One reason is that they consistently achieved high television ratings in the face of great competition from the annual Bowl games and the unprecedented success of network television, not just in sports broadcasting but also in entertainment. Many of the presenters and commentators of yesteryear did not have the luxury of assuming responsibility for masterminding a package and maintaining a coherent presentation. In many cases, they did not have the technological equipment that made the most effective use of today's media techniques, and they did not have the ability to create schedules that were anywhere near as diverse as today's. Often they relied on an ad-libbed formula in which one line or story led to the next. For example, a popular time-honored formula, termed \"the three double-drops\" (A, B, C) that started with a two-by-four striking a pair of cinder blocks and continued with more wood, was first",

Whereas, children in less developed countries have to cross borders frequently to access schools located in their surrounding areas. In high populated countries where schools are widely spread apart, getting to and from school can be quite a hassle. Since thechildren have to travel to school, there will be large number of vehicles on the road. The government is trying to solve this problem by setting up a road transportation network for children between school and school, so that the children can go directly from school to home.For example, in the United States of America, a company called All-american Paving, has made several models of road transportation network for children. The network has different lanes for different age groups; for example, for children under the age of ten, the width of the lanes is one metre wide. For children aged from ten to thirteen, the width of the lanes is increased to three metres and for children aged fourteen to seventeen, the width of the lanes is doubled to six metres. All these lanes are separated by cement blocks called as speed bumps. Since the speed bumps are only in the lanes, a truck can travel through the lanes safely, due to the",
